For this task, I was required to create a currency swap form. The total development time was approximately 8 hours.

 **Technologies and Packages Used**
I used the following tools and technologies to build this project:

1. **Framer Motion** – for intro animations
2. **Vite.js** – as the build tool
3. **Tailwind CSS** – for styling
4. **React Icons** – for icons
5. **TypeScript** – for static typing

 **Design and Development Process**

First, I researched similar projects and took inspiration from platforms such as **Dribbble**, **Nicepage**, and **TemplateMonster**.
After that, I designed the user interface in **Figma**.
Once the design was ready, I started development using React and the tools listed above.
After completing the project, I deployed it to **Vercel**.
